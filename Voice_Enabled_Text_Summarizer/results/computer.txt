 The outputs (sum, carry out) is determined based on the inputs (a, b, carry in) according to the following table:A   B    Carry In  |  Carry Out  Sum   0   0        0    ->     0        00   0        1    ->     0        10   1        0    ->     0        10   1        1    ->     1        01   0        0    ->     0        11   0        1    ->     1        01   1        0    ->     1        01   1        1    ->     1        1Using Boolean logic, the above can be described as Sum = A Control Unit:  The control unit takes in the program, reads in the machine code values (or bytes), and then operates the memory and execution units accordingly.  Computer memory has ranged from hard-wired switches, to punch cards, drum memory, bubble memory, floppy disks, hard drives, optical disks, solid-state memory, and experimental media such as holographs and quantum dots.  At the lowest level, a program is encoded in machine code, direct binary values that each encode a single action for the computer, such as reading a value from memory, or adding two values together.  Separating the control and the execution units makes desiging computers much easier, since the control only needs to tell the execution units 'do this', and the execution units do not need to deal with the details of the machine code interpretation.  Conscripted into the army, he lead a team in designing the Z3, which had  a 64-number memory, which each number being 22 binary digits (bits) long.  The Z3 was finished in 1941, and was the first-ever  working general purpose programmable computer.  These languages hide the lower level details from the programmer, using compilers to automatically convert abstract program code into the computer's native machine code.  The computer must transfer two values from the main memory into an execution unit, which then performs the addition.  For small, embedded computer systems, programmers sometimes still work in Assembly languages, which use simple english mnemonics for each machine code instruction.  It was to have a memory store, an execution unit, and it would operate on a formula (in modern usage, computer programs), and it would be able to calculate any expression.  Assuming no higher-priority tasks are executing in the computer, the controller issues an interrupt to the control unit, telling it to immediately switch tasks and pay attention to the keyboard.  Built by a group in Bletchley Park, England which included Alan Turing who became one of the pioneers of Computer Science, the Colossus can be considered the first completely electronic computer, even though it could only perform the specialized task of breaking Enigma codes. A Program:  A program is a sequence of instructions for the computer, telling it what to do with the data stored in its memory.  The control unit sends out signals that transfer the values in the registers to the execution unit, and then signals to the unit to begin addition. Execution Units:  These take binary values from the memory, and operate on them, returning the result into the memory.  The control and execution units, and sometimes limited amounts of memory, are typically on a single silicon chip, known as the Central Processing Unit, or CPU.  User interfaces for computers have also evolved a great deal over the last fifty years, from blinking rows of lights showing memory values, to modern monitors, keyboards, and mice.  John Atanasoff and Clifford Berry designed, and partially constructed a fully electronic machine based on eletronic valves, but the Atanasoff-Berry Computer (or ABC) was never completed.  Computer science research is pushing forward on dozens of fronts, making computers more complex, more powerful, and hopefully more useful daily.  The code fetches the keypress information, and places it in a queue data structure in memory for the rest of the operating system.  Additionally, computers are now typically connected to others through computer networks (such as the Internet, of course), allowing for widespread information exchange.  While most modern computers are purely electrical devices, the history of computers is steeped in mechanical contraptions of ever-increasing complexity.  A base-two system is therefore a natural platform for a computer built on switches, operating with Boolean logic.  Boole created the algebra to evaluate the truth of logical propositions; his system is now the basis of every digital computer.  Ten years later, Babbage conceived of the Analytic Engine, a true modern computer.  The long numbers preceded by zeros are the memory locations of the values used in the calculation, represented in hexadecimal, or base-16.  The clock makes the sequencing of operations in a computer simpler, guaranteeing valid results from one stage of computation to the next.  Seeing the keypress, the routine determines which executing program was the recipient, and places a keypress event on that program's event queue.  As computers have evolved in complexity, high-level programming languages (such as C, Ada, and LISP) have been created to simplify the creation of complex programs.  Designed by J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly, it was the first working fully electronic general-purpose computer.  Data is sent to main computer describing the event  Meanwhile, research in the United States followed similar lines: Howard Aiken constructed the Mark 1, using electromechanical relays, with speeds similar to the Z machines.  A second field of research is quantum computers, where computations are performed in ways radically different than current digital systems.  The MOV command instructs the computer to move a piece of data from one place to another.  Computers run set routines, called programs, that combine these operations into complex tasks.  A simple adder circuit has the same circuit per pair of digits, with two single-digit inputs, a carry in, a carry out, and the sum output.  Significant advances in computer technology take place at an amazing pace.  Its internal program logic determines the significance of pressing the equals key, and it begins to process the actual calculation.  The control is often a state machine of varying complexity.  Babbage is considered to be the inventor, if not the implementor, of the true computer.  All these actions take hundreds of steps in machine code each.  The units are often specialized, some working with integer values, others with real numbers represented in binary.  In modern systems, several execution units are placed on the each CPU chip.  In assembly language, the code might look like this:MOV DX, 00014B24MOV AX, @DXMOV DX, 00014B28MOV BX, @DXADD AX, BXMOV DX, 00014B2CMOV @DX, AXwhich, to an assembly programmer, is not hard to read.  A basic definition from typical web sources spits out:com.put.er     Countess Lovelace documented the design throughly, and became the first known programmer when she developed formulas for the planned machine. In C-code, the actual calculation might look like this:  ... case EQUALS: Pronunciation Key  (km-pytr)n.   1.  Today, a hand-held calculator has more power than the computers that powered the Apollo modules.  Recent advances include SIMD units (such as the Altivec), pipelined execution, and many other features to increase speed.  The machine could perform a multiplication in 5 seconds.  In the end, neither was the Difference Engine, the half-built machine now residing in the Science Museum in London.  The result must then be moved back into memory.  Multiplied millionfold, the result is a modern CPU, requiring constant active cooling to keep the chip from frying.  Simple to construct, but allows addition and multiplication to be done with relatively high speed.  It routes the two values to the inputs of the adder, and waits a clock phase or two.  No copies of the machine remain today.  In the middle and end, the instrumentalists come in, one section at a time, playing a simple little melody.  Commercial companies are currently trying for 0.09 micron technology, where the smallest feature that can be created is 0.09 microns wide.  It may be interrupted at any point by the scheduler to allow more critical routines to execute (such as interrupt routines).
